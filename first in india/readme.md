# Valeo 430 mm Pressed Clutch Cover Plate Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project represents the **first successful development of a 430 mm pressed clutch cover plate** in India, executed for **Valeo**. Unlike conventional cast clutch covers, this was developed through **sheet metal pressing using a large-scale press tool and die system**, marking a breakthrough in indigenous manufacturing capability.

## üõ† My Contribution
- Conducted **manufacturing feasibility studies** and analyzed **2D drawings** to establish tool requirements.  
- Designed and developed the complete **press tool and die assembly** in CAD, incorporating **simulation feedback** for accuracy.  
- Applied **DFMEA methodology** to predict and mitigate failure modes in the forming process.  
- Supervised the **manufacturing of tool components**, coordinated inter-department processes, and led **tool assembly and commissioning**.  
- Conducted **tool trials** and validated first-off components against 2D drawings and GD&T standards.  
- Delivered the project **within a short timeline** by coordinating cross-functional teams and concurrent engineering practices.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Significance
- **First-of-its-kind in India**: While large clutch covers (430 mm) exist in the market as **cast parts**, this is the **first time such a component was locally manufactured using press tool technology**.  
- **Press tool challenges**: Achieving precise forming at such scale required overcoming difficulties like:  
  - Very high press tonnage requirements  
  - Control of material spring-back and thinning in large sheet forming  
  - Tool deflection and alignment accuracy  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Lighter and more material-efficient than casting  
  - Higher dimensional accuracy and repeatability  
  - Cost-effective for large-scale production  

## üìä Outcome
- Successfully delivered **India‚Äôs first pressed 430 mm clutch cover plate**.  
- Fully met **Valeo‚Äôs 2D drawing, tolerance, and GD&T requirements**.  
- Established a new **benchmark in local manufacturing capability**.
